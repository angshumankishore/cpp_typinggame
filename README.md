# ðŸ§  Typing Game (C++ Command Line)

A simple command-line typing game built in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming concepts. This project is great for beginners who recently learned about classes, vectors, constructors, and basic game loops.

## ðŸŽ® How It Works

- The game shows you a random word.
- You try to type it correctly.
- You get points for each correct word.
- Play through a set number of rounds and see your final score!

## ðŸ›  Features

- Random word generation from a list
- Score tracking
- Beginner-friendly, minimal code
- Fully terminal-based, no external libraries

## ðŸ§± Built Using

- C++
- `vector<string>` for word list
- `rand()` and `srand()` for random selection
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

1. **Clone this repo** (if on GitHub):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/typing-game.git
   cd typing-game
   ```

2. **Compile the code**:
   ```bash
   g++ -o typinggame typinggame.cpp
   ```

3. **Run the game**:
   ```bash
   ./typinggame
   ```

## âœ¨ Learning Objectives

- Practice C++ Classes & Objects
- Use Vectors effectively
- Handle randomization in C++
- Build your first mini-game!
